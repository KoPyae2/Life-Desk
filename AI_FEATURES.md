Hi John! Here are some productivity tips:

1. Use the /note command to capture ideas instantly
2. Break big tasks into smaller todos with /todo
3. Track your spending with /expense to stay focused
4. Review your weekly progress with /summary

The key is consistency - start small and build habits!

🖼️ Image Analysis

I can see a workspace with a computer, scattered papers, coffee cup, and various office supplies. The desk appears cluttered with documents, a keyboard, mouse, and some personal items. There's also what looks like a notebook and some pens scattered around.

🖼️ Image Analysis

I can see a cluttered workspace that would benefit from organization. I'd recommend starting with the papers - sort them into folders, then clear the desk surface, and finally organize the supplies into designated containers.
